Löb and möb: strange loops in Haskell
=====================================

Every once in a while, people recognize [strange loops][strange-loops] in
unexpected places. This is one of them, in the form of a Haskell function.



`loeb`
------

`loeb` is one of those functions in Haskell that are amazing, crazy, simple and
complicated in equal parts.

1. The implementation is very simple to write.
2. The implementation is hard to understand.
3. It is easy to use.
4. It is explainable.



### Implementation

Feeling smart? Let's change that, here's `loeb`:

```haskell
loeb :: Functor f => f (f a -> a) -> f a
loeb x = go where go = fmap ($ go) x
```

That settles the first two points from above (the first one being accomplished
using trial-and-error typechecker abuse).



### What `loeb` does

Short version: `loeb` calculates a result in terms of itself, but with more
crazy than what you felt when you first heard about recursion.

Long version: what is this thing useful for? It can be used to implement
spreadsheet-like behaviour if the functor is `[]`:

Take a list of functions mapping lists to values, `fs :: [[a] -> a]`. These
functions can each be applied to some other list `xs :: [a]`. For each function
`f` in `fs`, applying it to `xs` results in a value `r`; call this collection
of values `rs`. This in code form reads

```haskell
xs :: [a]
xs = [...]

fs :: [[a] -> a]
fs = [...]

rs :: [a]
rs = [ f xs | f <- fs ]  -- r = f xs
```

This computes `rs` out of the given lists `xs` and `fs`.

Now the crux: it is possible to not take `xs` as given, using `rs` instead. In
other words, the `f` are applied to the list of results they produce.

```haskell
fs :: [[a] -> a]
fs = [...]

rs :: [a]
rs = [ f rs | f <- fs ]
```

This of course relies heavily on laziness, as it computes `rs` in terms of
itself. Instead of having `fs` as its own definition, let's supply it as a
parameter to `rs`:

```haskell
rs fs = [ f (rs fs) | f <- fs ]
```

and as it turns out, `rs = loeb`. Therefore, `loeb` takes a list of functions,
and calculates the list of results they produce when applied to the list of
results they produce. Strange? Check! Loop? You bet!

An example should make using it clearer:

```haskell
fs = [ const 1
     , succ . (!! 0)
     , succ . (!! 1)
     , succ . (!! 2)
     ]
```

This describes a list where the list elements are defined in terms of the
previous result value. `const 1` is the first element of the function list, and
applied to the resulting list it is always `1`; therefore the resulting list's
first element is `1`. `succ . (!! 0)` applied to the resulting list can now be
calculated: the indexing results in the previously calculated `1`, and `succ`
makes it a `2`. The second result element will therefore be `2`. This pattern
repeats itself, resulting in

```haskell
loeb fs ==> [1,2,3,4]
```

The interesting part is that the order of the functions is not necessarily
left-to-right. The list elements can be swapped around, as long as the
circularity is still resolved (otherwise the function won't terminate):


```haskell
fs = [ succ . (!! 1)
     , succ . (!! 3)
     , succ . (!! 0)
     , const 1
     ]

loeb fs ==> [3,2,4,1]
```

So this is like a spreadsheet, right? One cell's value is known, and the other
cells refer to each other in some way. When the evaluation terminates, each
cell has a defined value. In a sense this is like a generalization of a fixed
point combinator.


### Spreadsheets!

The lists mentioned above are a little like spreadsheets with only one line.
But there are other functors closer to the real thing, arrays for example!

```haskell
import Data.Array
import Data.List
import Control.Monad
import Text.Printf

loeb :: Functor f => f (f a -> a) -> f a
loeb x = go where go = fmap ($ go) x

-- Empty cell
e = val 0

-- Simple cell value
val = const

-- VAT of a cell's contents (10 %)
vat ix = (* 0.1) . (! ix)

-- Sum of the values at a list of indices
sum' ixs = \arr -> foldl' (\acc ix -> acc + arr ! ix) 0 ixs

spreadsheet = listArray ((0,0), (4,4))
--      Prices | VAT        | Effective prices + total
      [ val 1,   vat (0,0),   sum' [(0,i) | i <- [0..1]],   e,   e
      , val 3,   vat (1,0),   sum' [(1,i) | i <- [0..1]],   e,   e
      , val 5,   vat (2,0),   sum' [(2,i) | i <- [0..1]],   e,   e
      , val 2,   vat (3,0),   sum' [(3,i) | i <- [0..1]],   e,   e
      ,     e,           e,   sum' [(i,2) | i <- [0..3]],   e,   e
      ]

printArr :: Array (Int, Int) Double -> IO ()
printArr arr =
      forM_ [0..4] $ \i -> do
            forM_ [0..4] $ \j ->
                  printf "%4.1f   " (arr ! (i,j))
            printf "\n"

main = printArr $ loeb spreadsheet
```

Run it! The output will be

```
 1.0    0.1    1.1    0.0    0.0
 3.0    0.3    3.3    0.0    0.0
 5.0    0.5    5.5    0.0    0.0
 2.0    0.2    2.2    0.0    0.0
 0.0    0.0   12.1    0.0    0.0
```

where in the first column you'll see the prices (declared using `val` above),
the second column is the added tax to the price on its left, the third lists
the effective price, and below the effective prices there's the total sum you
have to pay in order to buy everything. Magic! :-)




`moeb`
------

`moeb` is the result of playing around with `loeb`'s definition: what if we
abstract over the `fmap` too? First and foremost, it makes the type signature
go crazy:

```haskell
-- [m]oeb = multi-loeb :-)
moeb :: (((a -> b) -> b) -> c -> a) -> c -> a
moeb f x = go where go = f ($ go) x
```

`loeb` can now be recovered as `moeb fmap`. But are there other parameters that
are useful for `f`? Well,

```haskell
moeb id x = id ($ moeb id x) x
          = ($ moeb id x) x
          = x (moeb id x)

-- This has the same form as
-- fix f = f (fix f)
==> moeb id = fix
```

This shows how `moeb` is a generalization of `fix`. Being a recursive function
itself, the converse is of course also true,

```haskell
moeb f x = fix (\go -> f ($ go) x)
```

so `moeb` and `fix` are different flavours of the same kind of recursion.

There are other functions that can be used as parameter to `moeb` such as
`traverse` and `foldMap`, but I don't know of any useful applications for them.
